            <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
            <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: 24 February 2026</p>

            <p>At BondBack Hero, we are committed to delivering high-quality services and ensuring customer satisfaction. This Refund Policy outlines the terms under which refunds, credits, and remedies are available for our checkout reports, bond advocacy, and cleaning services.</p>
            <p>This policy should be read in conjunction with our <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

            <h2>1. Checkout Reports</h2>

            <h3>1.1 Self-Service Plan ($29)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Since this is a digital product (templates and guides) delivered immediately upon purchase, refunds are generally not available once the materials have been accessed or downloaded.</li>
                <li>If you experience a technical issue preventing access to the materials, contact us within 7 days and we will resolve the issue or provide a full refund.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Professional Plan ($99–$249)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Before report preparation begins:</strong> Full refund available if you cancel before we commence work on your report.</li>
                <li><strong>After report preparation has begun:</strong> A partial refund may be available, minus the cost of work already completed. We will assess on a case-by-case basis.</li>
                <li><strong>After report delivery:</strong> If you are not satisfied with the quality of the report, contact us within 14 days. We will either revise the report at no extra cost or offer a partial refund, at our discretion.</li>
                <li>Refunds are not available solely because the report did not result in a successful bond claim, as outcomes depend on factors outside our control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.3 Bond Advocate Plan ($249–$549)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Before service commencement:</strong> Full refund available.</li>
                <li><strong>After service has commenced:</strong> Refunds are calculated on a pro-rata basis, reflecting the proportion of services already delivered.</li>
                <li><strong>Bond-back guarantee (where applicable):</strong> Our guarantee relates to the quality of our service and documentation, not to the outcome of your bond claim. If we fail to deliver the agreed-upon services, you may be eligible for a full or partial refund.</li>
                <li>No refunds will be issued solely because a bond claim was unsuccessful, a tribunal ruled against you, or the landlord/agent did not agree to release the bond.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Cleaning Services</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Cancellation Before Service</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>48+ hours notice:</strong> Full refund or free rescheduling.</li>
                <li><strong>24–48 hours notice:</strong> 50% refund or free rescheduling (subject to availability).</li>
                <li><strong>Less than 24 hours notice:</strong> No refund. The full service fee applies.</li>
                <li><strong>No-show (no cancellation):</strong> No refund. The full service fee applies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 After Service Completion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bond-back cleaning guarantee:</strong> If the property does not pass the agent's cleaning inspection, we will return to re-clean the identified areas at no extra cost (subject to conditions in our <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a>).</li>
                <li>If a re-clean does not resolve the issue and the complaint relates specifically to our cleaning quality, we may offer a partial refund at our discretion.</li>
                <li>Refunds are not available for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pre-existing damage, stains, or conditions that cannot be resolved through cleaning</li>
                        <li>Issues outside the scope of the agreed cleaning service</li>
                        <li>Items not identified during the initial re-clean request</li>
                        <li>Complaints made more than 7 days after the service date</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.3 Property Access Issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If our cleaning team is unable to access the property at the scheduled time due to reasons beyond our control (e.g., incorrect keys, tenant still occupying the property, no access arranged), the booking may be treated as a no-show.</li>
                <li>If we are unable to complete the clean due to our own scheduling error, you will receive a full refund or free rescheduling.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. General Refund Conditions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All refund requests must be submitted in writing to <a href="mailto:hello@bondbackhero.com.au">hello@bondbackhero.com.au</a>.</li>
                <li>Refund requests must include your name, booking reference (if applicable), and a description of the issue.</li>
                <li>We aim to respond to all refund requests within 5 business days.</li>
                <li>Approved refunds will be processed to the original payment method within 10 business days.</li>
                <li>Refunds do not include any third-party fees (e.g., payment processing fees) that are non-recoverable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Chargebacks</h2>
            <p>We encourage you to contact us directly before initiating a chargeback with your bank or payment provider. We are committed to resolving issues fairly and promptly. Initiating a chargeback without first contacting us may delay resolution and may result in suspension of your account.</p>

            <h2>5. Australian Consumer Law</h2>
            <p>Nothing in this Refund Policy limits your rights under the Australian Consumer Law. If our services have a major failure (as defined under the Australian Consumer Law), you are entitled to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cancel the service and obtain a refund for any unused portion, or</li>
                <li>Seek compensation for the difference between the value of the services provided and the price paid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For minor failures, we will re-perform the service within a reasonable time or provide a refund for the defective portion.</p>

            <h2>6. Exceptions and Special Circumstances</h2>
            <p>We understand that unexpected events happen. If your circumstances change due to factors beyond your control (e.g., medical emergency, natural disaster, sudden change in tenancy arrangements), please contact us. We will consider exceptions to this policy on a compassionate, case-by-case basis.</p>

            <h2>7. Promotional Offers and Discounts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Services purchased at a discounted rate are eligible for refunds based on the discounted amount paid, not the original price.</li>
                <li>Bundled services (e.g., checkout report + cleaning) may have individual refund terms for each component.</li>
                <li>Free or complimentary services are not eligible for monetary refunds.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with a revised "Last updated" date. The policy in effect at the time of your purchase will apply to that transaction.</p>
