            <p>Welcome to BondBack Hero. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the BondBack Hero website, products, and services (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our Services.</p>

                <li><strong>Checkout Reports:</strong> Professional property condition reports for tenants moving out of rental properties in New South Wales and Victoria.</li>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> BondBack Hero is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice. Our services are informational and practical in nature. For legal advice, you should consult a qualified legal professional. Any guidance we provide is based on our understanding of the Residential Tenancies Act 2010 (NSW) and the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC) and should not be relied upon as legal counsel.</p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 18 years of age to use our Services. By using our Services, you represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement.</p>

            <h2>3. Account and Information Accuracy</h2>
            <p>You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information when using our Services (including when submitting enquiry forms or booking services). You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of your information and for any consequences of providing false or misleading details.</p>

            <h2>4. Service Delivery</h2>

            <h3>4.1 Checkout Reports</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reports are prepared based on information and evidence you provide, combined with our professional assessment.</li>
                <li>We aim to deliver reports within the timeframe specified at the time of booking, but delivery times are estimates and not guaranteed.</li>
                <li>The accuracy and effectiveness of your report depends in part on the quality and completeness of information you provide.</li>
                <li>We do not guarantee any specific outcome regarding your bond claim. Results depend on your individual circumstances, the property manager or landlord involved, and applicable laws.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.2 Cleaning Services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cleaning services are performed by BondBack Hero or third-party contractors engaged by us.</li>
                <li>Our "bond-back guarantee" means that if the property fails the agent's cleaning inspection, we will return to re-clean the specific areas identified as unsatisfactory, at no additional cost. This guarantee is subject to the following conditions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The property must have been vacant and free of personal belongings during the clean.</li>
                        <li>The re-clean request must be made within 7 days of the original cleaning date.</li>
                        <li>Issues raised must relate to cleaning quality, not pre-existing damage, structural issues, or items outside the scope of the original booking.</li>
                        <li>You must provide a copy of the agent's inspection report or written feedback identifying the unsatisfactory areas.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>We reserve the right to refuse a re-clean if the conditions above are not met or if the complaint is not related to our cleaning quality.</li>
                <li>Cleaning does not include repair of pre-existing damage, mould remediation requiring specialist treatment, pest control, or hazardous material removal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.3 Bond Advocacy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Our bond advocacy service includes negotiation with landlords or agents on your behalf and preparation of documentation for tribunal proceedings.</li>
                <li>We are not legal representatives and cannot appear on your behalf at NCAT, VCAT, or any other tribunal or court.</li>
                <li>We do not guarantee the outcome of any negotiation or tribunal proceeding.</li>
